# BHARAT MAPS
Bharat Maps is a multi-layer GIS platform created by NIC/DeitY  to provide access to GIS data as a service to various Mission mode projects and e-gov divisions of NIC at Central and State level.

We used the [BHARAT MAPS GIS Service](https://bharatmaps.gov.in/newversion/map.aspx) to obtain datasets of `health centres`, `schools`, `roads` and `rails` for the State of Himachal Pradesh.

This is a snapshot data that we obtained as on May 2024.

**Variables extracted from the source:** 
1. `Number of hospitals in each sub district`
2. `Number of schools in each sub district`
3. `Length of roads in each sub district`
4. `Length of rail network in each sub district`

## Project Structure
- `data`: Contains datasets sourced from BHARATMAPS.
