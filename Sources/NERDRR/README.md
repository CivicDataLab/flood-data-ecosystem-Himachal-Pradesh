One such dataset that is needed for Flood Management is the data on embankments. It is available with the name  `NERDRR_NEW:embank`

792 features are present in the embankment dataset hosted by NERDRR. The length of these embankments in each of the revenue circle has been calculated. It is stored in the variable `embankment_length`
