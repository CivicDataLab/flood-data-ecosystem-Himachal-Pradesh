# Intelligent Data Solution for Disaster Risk Reduction (IDS-DRR) 
*Previously IDEA-FRM*

In Assam, the most visible risk is flooding. As per a study by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, the state ranks 2nd in the flood risk index. Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) has initiated the process of disaster risk reduction (DRR). ASDMA has aligned with recommendations in SFDRR through multiple ways like preparing Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Roadmap for Assam, capturing daily flood damage data through Flood Response Information Management System (FRIMS), maintaining a web GIS portal and more.

Data that could enable more effective disaster-risk response and management is scattered or siloed across different agencies, at different scales and formats, making it difficult for decision-makers and relevant stakeholders to make data-informed decisions. The availability of good quality, machine-readable, and interoperable data is crucial for effective climate action and disaster response. However, in India, this data is fragmented and siloed, scattered across different agencies, making it difficult for decision-makers to make data-informed decisions in a timely manner.

We have developed a data model for combining climate, losses & damages, procurement and demographic data for effective flood mitigation strategies in Assam state. Our solution leverages advanced data science techniques to derive insights for decision makers and make it into a user-friendly, interactive open-access tool.

With IDS-DRR, we are keen to build on the IDEA-FRM project by building data pipelines so that datasets are updated automatically and thus data-driven governance can be installed.
