## Abstract
To address the recurrent flooding in Assam, India, the government is seeking to identify the most susceptible areas to bolster its preparedness and response tactics. In our project, we utilized feature engineering, the Random Forest Classification model, and K-means clustering to categorize each Revenue Circle (an administrative division) in Assam according to the degree of flood damage experienced.
